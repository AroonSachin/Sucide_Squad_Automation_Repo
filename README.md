1.Commenting & Documentation:

        Java  documentation is great. It helps us to get info about which method,class and we can use Block tags names 
        
        We can create our own packages documentation in java     
        
2.Consistent Indentation:

        I used to code in style 2 but recently switched to style 1.But that is only a matter of preference. 
        
        There is no "best" style that everyone should be following Actually, the best style is a consistent style.
        
        If you are part of a team you should follow the existing style that is being used in that project.        
        
3.Avoid Obvious Comments:

        If you must comment on that code, you can simply combine it to a single line instead Comments should ideally explain
        
        If you have to write more than a one-line comment to explain what the code is doing.
               
4.Consistent Naming Scheme:

        First of all, the names should have word boundaries. There are two popular options:
        
        Pascal case: Is similar to camel case, but the first letter is always capitalized (like PersonOne, TextUtil, ThingsToDo).It will be mostly use in class names
        
        camelCase: The first letter of each word is capitalized, except the first word, (like parseRawImageData).It will be use in method name,interfaces and variables
              
5.DRY Principle:

        DRY stands for Don't Repeat Yourself. Also known as DIE: Duplication is Evil.
        
        The same piece of code should not be repeated over and over again.
                
6.Limit Line Length:

        It is a good practice to avoid writing horizontally long lines of code.
        
        Im working with java if i hit ctrl+shift+f it will auto my code in eclipse.
        
7.Unnecessary Objects Creation:

        Object Creation is one of the most memory consuming operation that is why the best java practice is to avoid making any unnecessary objects 
        
        They should only be created when required.
        
8.Never leave a Catch Blocks empty:

        It is a java best practice preferred by elite developers to write a proper and meaningful message in the catch block while exception handling.
        
        When the program gets an exception, it does not show anything, making debugging harder and time-consuming.  
        
9.Using Underscores in Numeric Literals:

        This little update from Java 7 helps us write lengthy numeric literals much more readable.
        
        So remember to use underscores in numeric literals to improve readability of your code.
        
10.Ordering Class Members by Scopes:

        The best practice we should sort the members by the visibility of the access modifiers: private, default (package), protected, and public.
        
        And the members in each group are sorted by alphabetic order.
        
        This private-first and public-last style helps us quickly locate member variables when the list grows up over times.
